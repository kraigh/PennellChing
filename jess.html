		<p>
		<span class="firstword">Jessica</span> was born and raised on the mission field of Taiwan to wonderful parents who were committed to Christ. From their example she learned importance of the Great Commission in the life of a believer. Jesus'  last words on earth were to “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations...” As she grew up on the mission field she saw committed believers doing just that in many different ways. While in Taiwan, Jessica noticed many missionaries who had to leave their work in the field because of financial difficulties.
		</p>
		<p>
		As she got older she began taking steps to make the Great Commission an absolute reality in her life. At 16 she spent 3 months in the Amazon Jungle in Brazil with Teen Missions International sharing Christ. Since then she made a personal commitment that her life would be centered around missions in any way God would allow. She has visited and lived in 15 countries and has no plans to stop as God opens the doors.
		</p>
		<p>
		Jessica graduated with a BA double major in Intercultural Ministries and Bible from Grace University in Omaha, NE. Following her graduation, she went to work with KPMG, the world's largest public accounting firm. During her years there she coordinated details of office meetings including travel of attendees, timing, and catering and was involved with public marketing events. She also helped manage the day to day operations of running a large corporate office.  Through Jessica’s years of experience in the conservative corporate world, she learned the importance of quality and professionalism in management of organizational image.

		<p>
		When God opened the doors, Jessica joined the executive staff at Child Evangelism Fellowship, the world’s largest children’s ministry. While there she operated as a project manager on Information Technology projects, including major software purchasing and installation, subcontractor management, and website management. Jessica also coordinated all major conferences, including CEF’s International Conference, which involved twelve to fifteen hundred guests from more than 60 nations. . She and was the event coordinator for donor events and project manager for donor development projects. In this work, Jessica was responsible for venue selection, contract negotiation, guest speakers, program refinement, and the invitation process. Cumulatively, these events for CEF raised 8.5 million dollars over 3 years, predominantly from either new donors or those have significantly increased their giving as a result of the events.
		</p>
		<p>
		Because of her mind for strategy and project management experience, Jessica played a central role in CEF’s business practices team, analyzing and refining core business practices and systems for the organization.  In the spring of 2009, Jessica was asked to become the Director of Development at CEF but chose instead to follow God's leading and use the skills and talents He had been building into her for a broader impact on world ministries.
		</p>
		<p>
		From the time she was a child, Jessica has seen how lack of funding can limit the abilities of believers to carry out the Great Commission. It has since become a core conviction of hers that the Sovereign God will provide for His people, and the growth of His Kingdom, and it is her mission to help ministries meet their funding needs.
